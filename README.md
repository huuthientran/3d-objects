# 3d-objects
This is my project for `3D Object Transformation - Texture Mapping` lab within Computer Graphics course.

About this repo:
* Using C/C++ and `GLUT` library to generate several meshes included: <kbd>Cube</kbd>, <kbd>Sphere</kbd>, <kbd>Cylinder</kbd>, <kbd>Cone</kbd>, <kbd>Disk shape</kbd>, <kbd>Torus shape</kbd>, <kbd>Hyperboloid</kbd>, <kbd>Paraboloid</kbd>.
 
* Can toggle <kbd>Wireframe</kbd>/<kbd>Texture</kbd> mode by using mini-menu on the right click.

* Using `SOIL` library to load textures before binding into meshes.
